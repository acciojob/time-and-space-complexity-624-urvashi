<h1>Time, Space, And Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity measures the computational complexity of an algorithm, representing how long it takes to complete relative to the size of the input. Efficient algorithms optimize both, ensuring swift execution and minimal memory use.</p>
<p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures memory usage. An algorithm with O(n) space complexity uses memory proportional to the input size</p>

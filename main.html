<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
<p>Time Complexity gauges an algorithm's efficiency, optimizing solution time relative to input size for efficient problem solving.</p>
<p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the memory of algorithm,relative to the input size. It's expressed using Big O notation,such as O(n).</p>

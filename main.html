<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
<p>Time Complexity measures the computational complexity of an algorithm, representing how long it takes to complete relative to the size of the input. An efficient algorithms optimize both, ensuring swift execution and minimal memory use.</p>
<p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute, relative to the input size. An algorithm with O(n) space complexity uses memory proportional to the input size. Space Complexity is crucial for developing scalable solutions, especially in environments with limited memory resources, as it helps developers optimize data structures and minimize memory usage, ensuring efficient performance and preventing potential crashes or slowdowns.</p>

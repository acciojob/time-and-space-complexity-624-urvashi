<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
<p>Time Complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task. An efficient solution optimizes resources, minimizing waste and maximizing productivity.</p>
<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a releated to the amount of memory occupied by the program. For example, if a program takes an array size n as input, the space complexity of the programe become O(n).</p>

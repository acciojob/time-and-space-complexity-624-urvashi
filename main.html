	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity measures the computational efficiency of an algorithm, refelecting how long it takes to complete relative input size. An efficient algorithm strive to minimize time complexity,ensuring swift execution and optimal performance.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b>refers to the amount of memory used by the algorithm, often measured as O(n).</p>

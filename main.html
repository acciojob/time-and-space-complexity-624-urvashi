<h1>Time, Space, And Complexity</h1>
<p>Balacing Time Complexity and Space Complexity is key. Efficient algorithms optimize both, ensuring swift execution and minimal memory use.</p>
<p>Space Complexity measures memory usage. An algorithm with O(n) <b>Space Complexity</b> uses memory proportional to the input size.</p>
